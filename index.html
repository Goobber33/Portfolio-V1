    <aside class="side"><p>My Portfolio's first website was built with HTML and CSS. I used flexbox and other
      <br>techniques I
      learned in class to style my website. This website was built with a mobile first mindset, <br>as well as a
      fully immersive and interactive site, to catch the readers attention (And to show off some skills <br>I've
      learned.)<span tabindex="0" data-descr="Hover over the images below for a reactive display!"> Hover Mouse
