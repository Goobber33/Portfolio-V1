    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Kyle Parks, and I currently work for Intermax Networks in Coeur D Alene Idaho.<br>
      I am enrolled in the University of Washington's coding bootcamp, where I am learning
      to <br>become a Full Stack Web Developer. Please check out my page, and all the projects I
      am working on!</p>

      <p>My Portfolio's first website was built with HTML and CSS. I used flexbox and other
        <br>techniques I
        learned in class to style my website. This website was built with a mobile first mindset, <br>as well as a
        fully immersive and interactive site, to catch the readers attention (And to show off some skills <br>I've
        learned.)<span tabindex="0" data-descr="Hover over the images below for an interactive display!"> Hover Mouse
